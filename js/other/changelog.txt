ver 1.0
    - The LD 43 Jam version.
ver 1.1
    - Added spawning random followers. That makes game a bit less tedious, when all followers are dead or gone,
    - The recruitment action must be finished before next day starts, or else it will be aborted.
    - It's possible to paste text in "priest speech textfield". However, a 600 characters limit is applied.
    - Penalty for not meeting Evil Gods sacrifices quota is lower.
    - UI seen some minor improvements. I'm still working on it...
